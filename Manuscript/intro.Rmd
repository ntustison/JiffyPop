# Introduction

"Wisdom-of-crowds" [@Surowiecki2004] approaches to medical image segmentation have
proven remarkably successful.  Recent international competitions such as the
brain labeling challenge associated with the MICCAI 2012 Workshop on Multi-Atlas
Labeling and the 2013 MICCAI Challenge Workshop on Segmentation:
Algorithms, Theory and Applications have demonstrated the superiority of these
consensus-based approaches when coupled with high-performing image spatial
normalization algorithms.

Early techniques such as single atlas label assignment [@Heckemann:2006aa] and majority voting
[@Kitller:1998aa]
