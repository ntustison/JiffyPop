# Abstract

Multi-atlas consensus techniques have demonstrated remarkable utility in various medical
imaging segmentation tasks.  Joint label fusion (JLF) employs spatially normalized
atlas sets---gray-scale intensity images with corresponding segmentation labels---to
segment unlabeled images using various weighting schemes.  The technique
of [@Wang:2013aa;@Wang:2013ab] avoids informational redundancy in the atlas voting
scheme by considering the atlas set as a whole (versus individually) in determining
the optimal weights.  In this work we extend this methodology to the
estimation of intensity information in multi-modal image data sets, which
we denote as _joint intensity fusion (JIF)_.  JIF has several potential applications
including removal of imaging artifacts (e.g., motion), removal of pathologies
(e.g., tumour, lesions), imputation of missing modality data, and template
enhancement.  Evaluation is performed on a variety of data \textcolor{red}{
\ldots need more here}.  We provide an open-source implementation in the the well-known
Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) software package, based on the Insight Toolkit
coding standards, which subsumes the
functionality reported in [@Wang:2013ab] in addition to offering further
enhancements such as multi-threading and a non-negative least-squares calculation
of the atlas weights.
